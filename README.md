# Survey-App

Class project for Software Engineering

## Description

During our Software Engineering course a client was brought in who requested the creation of a mobile application that would allow
users to create, save and share question and answer lists.

In order to expose our class to agile development methods we were seperated into scrum teams and assigned issues to be completed over a
series of two week sprints. 

For version control we were introduced to and utilized Bitbucket and SourceTree.
The application itself was created using Andriod Studio.
